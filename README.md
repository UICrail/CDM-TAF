# CDM-TAF
Re-engineering the TAF TSI ontology, with FP5 demonstrator application in mind.

The challenge is to refer to TAF TSI concepts and concept schemes (as published by ERA in the TAF XSD, TAF ontology and associated concept schemes) to the largest extent possible, while making the present ontology suitable for use in combination with other ontologies.

The latest version of the "TAF revisited" ontology can be found [here](http://cdm.ovh/taf/taf.ttl)
