The present folder contains the TAF ontology expressed in GRAPHOL.

Quoting from [an OBDA Systems repository](https://github.com/obdasystems/eddy/wiki/Introduction#graphol):

> Graphol is a visual ontology language for OWL 2. Graphol's distinguishing feature is that it allows you to draw ontologies in a completely diagrammatic way. In other words, Graphol diagrams do not need to be annotated with formulas, even to capture complex axioms, everything can be represented graphically. Plus, Graphol can fully capture OWL 2, meaning that anything that you can say in OWL 2, you can also say in Graphol, and vice-versa.
> The basic elements of Graphol are borrowed from the Entity-Relationship (ER) model. This makes Graphol (and Eddy) particularly suited for engineers, analysts, or designers in general who are used to describing requirements and designing systems through modelling languages like ER or UML class diagrams.)
